How to use application:
 - Step 1: Make sure that dependencies are loaded. (Single executable w/ dependencies attached in case dependencies cannot be loaded, still requires Python)
 - Step 2: Use command line to run application, or use executable. 
 - Step 3: Once running, application will do the work and then display probabilties along with corresponding arbitrary codes and actual values of each variable
           depending on classifier. Application will then display the overall accuracy of the application.
